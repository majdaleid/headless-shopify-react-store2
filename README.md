3. Create an `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

Replace `your_shopify_app_access_token` with your Shopify app access token and `your_shopify_domain` with your Shopify domain. If you're running the project locally, keep `PUBLIC_URL` as `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.
