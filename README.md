# Headless Shopify React Store

This project allows you to easily develop a headless Shopify front store using React.js. It utilizes various technologies and packages including React.js, Styled Components, Context, React Hooks, React Router DOM, React Icons, and the Shopify Buy SDK.

## Getting Started

To start using this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository.

2. Create a development app in your Shopify store using the provided links.
   - Follow the instructions to create the app in just two clicks.
   - Make sure to mark the access scopes related to products in your Shopify store.
   - Find the access token in the app settings.

3. Create an `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:


Replace `your_shopify_app_access_token` with your Shopify app access token and `your_shopify_domain` with your Shopify domain. If you're running the project locally, keep `PUBLIC_URL` as `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

5. Start the development server by running `npm run start`.

The project will launch and be accessible at the specified `PUBLIC_URL`. The store is responsive, and you can select products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Clicking on checkout will automatically redirect you to your Shopify store with the real product information.
