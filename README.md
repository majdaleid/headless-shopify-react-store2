3. Create an `.env` file in the project root directory with the following variables:

Replace `your_shopify_app_access_token` with your Shopify app access token and `your_shopify_domain` with your Shopify domain. If you're running the project locally, keep `PUBLIC_URL` as `http://localhost:3000`.

4. Install the project dependencies by running `npm install`.

5. Start the development server by running `npm run start`.

The project will launch and be accessible at the specified `PUBLIC_URL`. The store is responsive, and you can select products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. Clicking on checkout will automatically redirect you to your Shopify store with the real product information.
